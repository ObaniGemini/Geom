# Geom : 0.1 release

A game about music, inertia, dodging, shooting, abstract and fancy particles

# History and contributing

#### History

Geom was born from the great frustration of seeing awesome game demos made with Godot Engine and never being continued. It came from the idea of making things by myself, taking a very promising project, **![top-down-inertia](https://github.com/KOBUGE-Incubator/top-down-inertia)** by @bojidar-bg, and make it grow in my way.

One of the first things I felt about the game was I had to abstract myself from many things. It came from sounds to graphics, and to text (except for menus).

#### Contributing

As my work is not linear at all, I won't make any commits, just share new releases, from time to time (if I feel the want to do it).

If you want to contribute, please use the ![Pull Requests Tool](https://github.com/ObaniGemini/Geom/pulls).
If I can add it directly, I will merge it into the project and add you to the credits. Else, if it breaks some things on my personal version, I will add it in my way and add you to the credits (but you will not appear in the git logs).

About maps, you can also contribute. If I don't find it correct enough, I can rework it. The most important is the main idea.
Also, if you think the maps are flat, think that it came from a great work of clean up. Think that a map must be playable, intuitive and look logical.

# Plans for future

- Better music
- Some better sounds
- Reworked graphics ?

- New level packs
- Reworked difficulty (easier in the beginning, harder in the end)
- **New packs system** : in the lobby, player might not loose lifes (but health-points yes), and there might be a constant counter of the highest score recorded on each pack. There might be different items to find on each packs to unlock the next one (e.g : have a highscore >= 20 stars for the pack 1 to unlock the pack 2)

- New entities and *more variations in gameplay/universe-discovery*

- Fixes and other things...
